# Stride-Classification
The primary motivation for this work is to reduce the time
burden required in the manual classification of non-trip toe-off
events. The rationale behind implementing a machine learning
solution is driven both by the high inter and intra-subject data
variability and the relatively large number of potential features/
input sources. Lastly, the implementation of any solution
can be used to classify toe-off events that an experimenter is
unsure of the classification.
